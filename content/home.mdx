      From control logic to full autonomy, AI is not an add-on—it's baked into the system. Build with pre-trained models, swap in new algorithms, or contribute your own. With integrated AI capabilities, the system supports learning algorithms, perception models, and autonomous behaviors—ready to evolve alongside your robot. Our system supports shared intelligence as easily as it supports shared parts.
